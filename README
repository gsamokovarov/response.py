-----
What?
-----

Response extends the excelent Requests library by Kenneth Reitz to save
you some typing.

----
How?
----

Instead of having to explicitly assign the response of a request to a named
local variable, response.py converts the Requests HTTP request methods to
context managers in which context the thread local variable response is
the current response. The context managers can be nested together as the
responses are stacked together.

Cough... How?
-------------

from response import get, response

api = lambda path: 'https://api.github.com' + path

with get(api('/repos/gsamokovarov/frames.py/contributors')):
    for metadata in response.json:
        print '%(login)s: %(contributions)d commits' % metadata
